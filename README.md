# Aquarium
# Multithreding & Design Pattern
The "Multithreading and Design Patterns GUI Aquarium" project focuses on developing a graphical user interface,
that simulates a digital aquarium with fish swimming in parallel using multithreading.
The project applies design patterns such as Singleton for managing aquarium resources and Observer for
notifications and status changes of the fish.
The goal of the project is to create an interactive environment that demonstrates efficient resource management
and real-time object movement.
