# Aquarium - Multithreading & Design Patterns

## About

The **"Multithreading and Design Patterns GUI Aquarium"** project is a graphical user interface that simulates a digital aquarium, where fish and jellyfish swim concurrently using multithreading.
It showcases the use of **design patterns** such as:

- **Singleton**: Manages shared aquarium resources.
- **Observer**: Tracks notifications and status changes of fish.
- **Factory Method**: Used to create different types of fish dynamically at runtime.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related objects, such as different species of sea creatures.
- **Decorator**: Allows fish to dynamically change their appearance or behavior (e.g., adding decorative elements or traits like speed).
- **State**: Manages the internal state of each fish or jellyfish (swimming, eating) and allows them to change behavior based on their current state.

Additionally, the project contains other important design patterns that are crucial for efficient resource management and ensuring smooth fish and Aquarium "behavior".

The project aims to demonstrate efficient resource management and real-time object movement in an interactive, digital environment.

## Features

- Real-time objects movement using multithreading.
- Resource management through the Singleton pattern.
- Animals behavior and state tracking using the Observer and State patterns.
- Dynamic Animals creation with Factory Method and Abstract Factory.
- Behavior and appearance enhancement using the Decorator pattern.

## Installation

1. Ensure **Java SDK** is installed on your system.
   - Download the latest version from the [Oracle Java Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
   
2. Add Java to your system's environment PATH if it's not already configured.

## Running the Application

1. Navigate to the `q3` directory in your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   java AquaFrame.java
